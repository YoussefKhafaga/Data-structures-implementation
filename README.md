## Stack
Convert from infix to postfix then postfix evaluation using stacks in C language. Implemented functions are push, pop, isempty, isfull and top of stack.<br />
example : Input (Infix): 2 + ( -2.5 + 3.14 ) * ( -5.4 + 8.1 ) ^ ( -0.5 )<br />
Output (Postfix): 2 -2.5 3.14 + -5.4 8.1 + -0.5 ^ * +<br />
Value: 2.389492<br />

## Queus
Simulation of round robin process handling using linked lists. Implemented functions are enqueue, dequeue and is empty.

## Doubly-linked-lists
Conversion from array to doubly linked list.

## Binary-trees
Search for word in dictionary in log(n) time, insertion and deletion of sentences in the binary tree.

## simple-interpreter
Storing of a key value pair inputs in BST, infix to postfix conversion using stacks, sorting by name in order traversal and sorting by value using heap sort.

## RB-trees
Using RB trees to store words of a dictionary, search for words and add or delete words.

## Sorting algorithms
Implementation of sorting algorithms such as bubble, insertion, selection, merge, heap and quick sort and comparison between them in time.
